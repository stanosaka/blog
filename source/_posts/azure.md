# Azure architecturue foundations
> subscriptions, management, governance
## Resource organization
- Management group for each environment (Prod, Dev, and Test)
- Subscription for each "application categorization"
- Separate resource group for each application
- Consistent nomenclature at each level of this hierarchy

## Naming Standards
- Azure resource names are important
- it's difficult to change names later
- Names must meet requirements specific to their resource type
[naming and tagging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging)
## Organize resources by Tag
- Allows you to add metadata to Azure resources
- Allows you to query resources using the same tags
- Not all resource types support tags
## Azure policy and RBAC
- Policies enforce rules against your resources
- Role-based access control (RBAC) controls user actions
## Resource locks
- Prevent accidental resource changes
## Monitorinig and alerting

The few roles have given to user:
1. Reader on subscription: let user view everthing, but not make any change
2. Storage Blob Data Reader on Storage account: Read and list azure storage containers and blobs.
