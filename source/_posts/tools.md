```
* means the deamon is listening on all IP addresses the server might have.

127.0.0.1 means the daemon is listening only to the loopback interface

::: is the same thing as *, but for IPv6

::1 is the same as 127.0.0.1, but for IPv6

## mtr

## cURL
is a tool and library for transferring data with URL syntax, capable of handling various protocols.
```
curl http://foobar/index.html
With the --request or -X parameter, the method can be specified. To include the the headers in the output.
curl -I --request GET  http://www.opsschool.org/en/latest/http_101.html
The -O switch makes cURL write output to a local file named like the remote file.
$ curl -O http://localhost/bigfile
```
By default cURL does not follow HTTP redirects, and instead a 3xx redirection message is given.
The -L switch makes cURL automatically follow redirects and issue another request to the given localtion till it finds the targeted resource.
```
curl -IL foobar.org
```
## netcat
a networking tool capable of reading and writing data across a network connection.
### Basic client/server
```
$ nc -l 192.168.0.1 1234 > output.log
### then in another terminal, pipe some data to netcat that is connected to the destination ip and port
$ echo "I'm connected as client"| nc 192.168.0.1 1234
## Then again in the first (server) terminal, the data is displayed:
$ cat output.log
I'm connected as client
```
