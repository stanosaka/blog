### Practice Conversation
Tips to develop conversational skills are given as under:
1. Starting a conversation: try to make them as commonplace as possible. For example:
- The food looks tempting. Doesn't it?
- The traffic was awful.
- What about parking? Where did you get it?
- The coffee appears good.
Don't let the startes become an interrogation but make your partner speak and watch for the response.

2. Joining a conversation: 'I am sure you won't mind if I join you.'

3. Ending a conversation: Be very polite and use the right time to leave the conversation.
- It's been fantastic talking to you.
