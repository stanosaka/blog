Question: How would you describe your personality?

Interviewers ask this question for a couple of reasons: to hear where you place the emphasis in your description, and to see how quickly and creatively you can think on the spot. Remember, the interviewer is trying to judge whether you will fit in.

Spice up your answer
Don’t give the interviewer the same tired, old answers everybody else gives. Try thinking of new ways to get your message across and sound enthusiastic about your personal traits. The following are some examples of boring answers and then better ones to describe your personality.

a high energy person: i am a person who is energized by challenges and problems.

a hard worker: I do whatever it takes to get the job done, sometimes working 10-hours days.

a quick learner: I can hit the ground running and come up to speed faster than anyone I know.

analytical: I'm known for my ability to analyze data and transform it into useful information.

very organized: I am a person who knows how to bring order to chaos.

reliable: I pride myself on my record of never missing deadlines, regardless of what it takes.

good with customers: I know how to build great relationships with customers. They always ask for me personally.

**Salary negotiation**
Interviewer’s question: “Could you tell me your salary requirement?”

Candidate’s answer: “I’d be glad to talk salary at the appropriate time, but I really don’t have enough facts at this time to discuss salary. I would be interested in hearing the range budgeted for this position as well as the entire benefits package.”

Candidate’s answer: “What does your company typically pay someone with my background and experience?”

Candidate’s answer: “I’ve done some research and have found an acceptable range for someone with my years of experience and education is (name a range). Is this the range that your company has budgeted for the position?”

Candidate’s answer: “I’m just not ready to talk salary without some more information from the company and what the job will entail so that I have something to compare it with. Rather than go back and forth, the range I would be interested in is $ [name a starting figure] to $ [name a closing figure].” Be sure the range is broad with an acceptable number at the low end. If you are offered your low-end number, you were the one who named the number, and it may be the number that they consider acceptable for you.

Candidate’s answer: “The base salary that I received in my last job was combined with an extremely generous benefits package and bonuses. I would need to hear the details of the package that you offer in order to compare.” (If, of course, this is true)

**A new interview technique**
The five-point system
1. Point One: Your education and years of experience. This includes any special licenses, certifications, or security clearances. (More experienced persons will talk mainly about experience and not focus on education. New students will focus on education with special classes or honors received.)
2. Point Two: Your area of expertise. What do you know a great deal about? This is the information from your knowledge-based skills exercise. It is important to emphasize your experience related to the job posting or description. (People with less experience will have to rely on classes taken or coursework done.)
3. Point Three: Your key strength. This is usually a trait that you can use in any job. The information from your transferable skills exercise can be used here (i.e., communication skills, relating to others, problem solving, time management).
4. Point Four: Your work ethic or work style. Refer to your personal traits list. This is what your coworkers would say about you if they were asked. Third-party endorsements work well here.
5. Point Five: Personal facts. Something interesting about you (a hobby, a volunteer job, a sport or activity that is of interest to you). If you can think of something that relates to the job you are applying for, that would be a plus. Use of personal facts can be an optional point, depending on your circumstances and what you have to say.

Here are some questions that could be answered by using all, or part of the five points:
Tell me about yourself.

What can you bring to the job that other candidates can’t?

What are your strengths?

What makes you unique?

Why should we hire you?

What do others say about you?

Describe your personality.

**Point One: Your Education and Experience**
If you have been working for several years, you will most likely want to focus on your “years of experience,” instead of your education, as your experience will become more important if you qualify for the position. 

Knowledge-based skills: skills you learned from experience and education: computer programs; graphics; languages; writing; training; leadership; science; coaching; sales; special skills; and others.

My statement examples: education and experience
I'll begin with my education, which includes a master of science in internetworking degree from UTS focus on networking administration. I also have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Added to that, I have eight years of experience working in the IT industry. Beginning with IT support officer, and have progressed through several promotions to devops platform engineer, which I have been doing for the past one year. I helped to automate the CI/CD process and provision our IT infrastructres for our team.

**Point Two: Your Area of Expertise**
An important factor in any interview is being able to distinguish yourself from the next “guy” who walks through the door. When asked what your area of expertise is, you should immediately think: “knowledge-based skills.” These are the skills you acquired from your years of education and experience.

Knowledge-based skills: knowledge of computer programs; graphics; languages; writing; training; management; science; coaching; sales; leadership; special skills, and so on.

My statement examples: area of expertise and knowledge

My expertise is my problem-solving ability. I am very analytical and computer savvy. I use these skills to view things from a strategic point of view.

**Point Three: Your Key Strengths**
Your key strength skills are your transferable skills that you can take with you to any job you hold. Identifying your transferable skills is especially important for anyone who is transferring to another field, or a different type of organization.

Transferable skills: skills that are portable such as communication, listening, decision making, judgment, initiative, negotiation, planning, organizing, time management, some leadership skills.

My statement examples: key strengths
My strength is my ability to solve problems. Throughout my life, it has been something that I have been able to do by looking at the issue and sorting through what is important and what is not important.

My strength is my ability to deal with people. This has a lot to do with the fact that I am a good listener and that I’m good at reading people. I have worked with a diversity of people and have always been able to adapt and get along by adjusting my style and vocabulary to meet the person’s level.

**Point Four: Your Work Ethic/Loyalty, Achievements**
What other traits or experiences would you like the employer to know about you? Your integrity, work ethic, or personal achievements apply here. 

A more comfortable way to talk about your work ethic and personal style is to think about how others see you. Dig out those old performance appraisals and read through those letters of reference for words to use (third-party endorsement)

Question: If I were to ask your coworkers to tell me three positive things about you—your personality, your work style, or what you are like to work with—what would they say?

My Statement Examples: Your Work Ethic/Loyalty, Achievements
I have a strong work ethic with an abundance of energy. I can work for hours and days and never tire. I sometimes surprise people who work with me by working for days with no breaks, and being on-call at night.

I consider myself to be very adaptable, and I can usually make friends in new situations. I will go out of my way to help someone who needs help. I try to get to know people on a deeper level.

**Example: Complete statement ofr a professional**
I'm the kind of person who keeps one eyes on the future while taking care of today's business. I know how to get things done, but at the same time I have
the ability to foresee areas that may become problems and put processes in place to prevent the problems from occurring.

I have been working in the IT industry for more than eight years now. My experience has been broad in that I have been very successful in designing high-avaiable infrastructures on public/private cloud infrastructures. I've worked in a number of companies in various industries, public sector, e-commence retail and forex broker companies on high-frequency trading technologies.

I believe my success can be attributed to my strong leadership and decision-making style. I talk to employees and managers and share the goals so that everyone is on the same page. I work with the under-achievers and put process improvements in place. I work with management to develop budgets that can be attained.

I would describe my style as open and honest. I share all pertinent information with the employees one-on-one and listen to their ideas, concerns, desires, and needs. I teach them to utilize resources and tools and provide feedback so that they realize their contribution to the organization.

When I look at your job posting, I can see myself in the role, bringing my vast knowledge and record of success in improving processes. I am very enthusiastic about your company and know that I could bring my creative and problem-solving ability to this job.

**Describe a time when you had to adapt to a new situation"
I was on call 24/7 one weekend, and when the phone rang on Sunday morning, I knew there was a problem. Sure enough, there was a mainframe that had gone down. The first thing I did was to cancel my plans for the day. I responded to the call within one hour. I teamed up with three technicians to get the system up and running before morning. We each had a responsibility but worked as a unit. We stayed until 2:00 a.m. When the employees arrived at work that morning, no one was aware there had been a problem. We got high kudos for responding so quickly.

**Your résumé states that you’re a ‘hard worker.’ Can you give me an example of a time when you worked hard?**
In my recent job, my boss had a really important project, and it didn’t look like we were going to make the deadline. I volunteered to do some late nights and weekends. My boss and two other coworkers worked seven straight days with no time off. My piece of the project was to coordinate all the information and enter the data. It was a real team effort, but we were able to meet the deadline. My boss was extremely pleased, and he rewarded us all for our efforts.
